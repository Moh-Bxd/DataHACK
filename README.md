# **DataHACK**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a molecule inhibits PTP1B, an enzyme linked to diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Using SMILES representations, we extract molecular features and train a classification model to distinguish between Active and Inactive compounds.

The goal is to optimize the model for high F1 Score while ensuring a well-documented and reproducible approach.
